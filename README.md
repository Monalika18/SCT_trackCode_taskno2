Image Encryption Tool

A web-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques. This project demonstrates a custom encryption method with key-based security and shift operations.

-> Features
- Encrypt images using a user-defined key and shift value.
- Decrypt images to restore the original state with the same key and shift.
- Interactive interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Supports real-time pixel manipulation on the browser canvas.

-> Demo
Upload an image, enter a key (e.g., "mysecretkey123") and shift value (e.g., 50), then use the "Encrypt" and "Decrypt" buttons to transform and restore the image.

-> Usage
- Upload an image file.
- Input a unique key and shift value.
- Click "Encrypt" to secure the image.
- Use the same key and shift to "Decrypt" and retrieve the original image.

-> Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling for a responsive UI.
JavaScript: Core logic for encryption and decryption.
